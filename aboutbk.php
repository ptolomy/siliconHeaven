			<h1>What are Silicon Wafers?</h1>

      <p>Wafers are formed of highly pure (99.9999999% purity), nearly defect-free single crystalline material.<br>
        One process for forming crystalline wafers is known as Czochralski growth invented by the Polish chemist Jan Czochralski.<br>
        In this process, a cylindrical ingot of high purity monocrystalline semiconductor, such as silicon or germanium, called a boule,<br>
        is formed by pulling a seed crystal from a 'melt'. Donor impurity atoms, such as boron or phosphorus in the case of silicon,<br>
        can be added to the molten intrinsic material in precise amounts in order to dope the crystal,<br>
        thus changing it into n-type or p-type extrinsic semiconductor.</p>
        <br>

     <p>Silicon wafers are available in a variety of diameters from 25.4 mm (1 inch) to 300 mm (11.8 inches). Semiconductor fabrication plants,<br>
        colloquially known as fabs, are defined by the diameter of wafers that they are tooled to produce.<br>
        The diameter has gradually increased to improve throughput and reduce cost with the current state-of-the-art fab using 300 mm,<br>
        with a proposal to adopt 450 mm. Intel, TSMC and Samsung are separately conducting research to the advent of 450 mm "prototype" (research) fabs,<br>
        though serious hurdles remain.<br>
        <br>
        1-inch (25 mm)<br>
        2-inch (51 mm) with thickness 275 µm.<br>
        3-inch (76 mm) with thickness 375 µm.<br>
        4-inch (100 mm) with thickness 525 µm. Or 4.9 inch (125 mm) with thickness 625 µm.<br>
        150 mm (5.9 inch, usually referred to as "6 inch") with thickness 675 µm.<br>
        200 mm (7.9 inch, usually referred to as "8 inch") with thickness 725 µm.<br>
        300 mm (11.8 inch, usually referred to as "12 inch") with thickness 775 µm.<br>
        450 mm (17.7 inch) with thickness 925 µm (proposed).<br>
        675-millimetre (26.6 in) Unknown thickness. (Theroretical).</p><br>
      <p>n order to minimize the cost per die, manufacturers wish to maximize the number of dies that can be made from a single wafer;<br>
        dies always have a square or rectangular shape due to the constraint of wafer dicing. In general,<br>
        this is a computationally complex problem with no analytical solution,<br>
        dependent on both the area of the dies as well as their aspect ratio (square or rectangular) and other considerations<br>
        such as scribeline size and the space occupied by alignment and test structures. Note that gross DPW formulas account only<br>
        for wafer area that is lost because it cannot be used to make physically complete dies;<br>
        gross DPW calculations do not account for yield loss due to defects or parametric issues.<br>

        Nevertheless, the number of gross die per wafer (DPW) can be estimated starting with the first-order approximation or wafer-to-die area ratio,<br>
      <br></p>

      <br>
      where {\displaystyle d} d is the wafer diameter (typically in mm) and {\displaystyle S} S the size of each die (mm2).<br>
      This formula simply states that the number of dies which can fit on the wafer cannot exceed the area of the wafer divided by the area of each individual die.<br>
      It will always overestimate the true best-case gross DPW, since it includes the area of partially patterned dies which do not fully lie on the wafer surface (see figure).<br>
      These partially patterned dies don't represent complete ICs, so they cannot be sold as functional parts.<br>
      <br>
      Refinements of this simple formula typically add an edge correction, to account for partial dies on the edge,<br>
      which in general will be more significant when the area of the die is large compared to the total area of the wafer.<br>
      In the other limiting case (infinitesimally small dies or infinitely large wafers), the edge correction is negligible<br>
